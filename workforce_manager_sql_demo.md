**Project Name:** Workforce_Manager_Demo

**Project Overview:**
The Workforce_Manager_Demo project aims to develop a comprehensive MySQL database to manage employee information effectively. This project is designed to facilitate a deeper understanding of SQL through hands-on practice and detailed documentation. By creating a functional database schema that includes tables for employees, departments, contact information, addresses, attendance, and leave management, users will gain practical experience in database design, development, and management.

**Key Features:**
1. **Employee Management:** Centralized storage of employee details including personal information, department affiliation, position, salary, and manager relationships.
   
2. **Department Organization:** Management of departmental data, including department names and heads, to structure the company's organizational chart within the database.

4. **Address Management:** Ability to store and manage multiple addresses for each employee, categorized by address type (e.g., Home, Work).
   
5. **Attendance Tracking:** A system to record and track employee attendance, including time-in and time-out data, to monitor and analyze work hours and productivity.
   
6. **Leave Management:** A comprehensive leave management system that allows for the recording of leave types, durations, and reasons, facilitating efficient leave administration.

**Benefits:**
- **Hands-on SQL Practice:** Offers practical experience in SQL database design, development, and query execution.
- **Comprehensive Employee Database:** Creates a structured and detailed repository of employee information, enhancing HR management capabilities.
- **Documentation-Driven Development:** Emphasizes the importance of documentation in understanding and utilizing SQL databases effectively.
- **Scalable Design:** The database schema is designed to be scalable, accommodating growth in employee numbers and organizational complexity.

**Implementation Stack:**
- **MariaDB:** A branch of MySQL that is fully compatible with Linux environments, chosen for database creation, management, and query execution. This choice reflects a commitment to open-source solutions and ensures compatibility across various development environments.
- **Documentation Tools:** Use of markdown and other documentation tools to create comprehensive guides and references.
- **Development Environment:** SQL development tools and environments such as MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin for database design and testing, with a specific focus on compatibility with MariaDB.

The Workforce_Manager_Demo project serves as a practical tool for those looking to deepen their understanding of SQL and database management, offering a real-world application scenario that covers various aspects of employee and organizational data handling.
