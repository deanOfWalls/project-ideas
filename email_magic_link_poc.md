**Project Name:** Email Magic Link Account Creation and Login POC for Message Board

**Project Description:**
The Email Magic Link Account Creation and Login Proof of Concept (POC) aims to demonstrate a simplified yet secure user registration and login system for a message board. Instead of traditional password-based authentication, this POC utilizes email magic links for account creation and authentication, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience for message board users.

**Key Features:**
1. **Email Magic Link Account Creation:** Users can create an account by providing their email address. Instead of setting a password, a magic link is sent to their email for account verification.

2. **Magic Link Authentication:** To log in, users simply click on the magic link received in their email. This link authenticates the user and logs them into the message board without the need for a password.

3. **Message Posting:** Registered users can post messages to the message board. Each message includes the username of the poster and a date/timestamp.

4. **User-Friendly Interface:** The message board provides a clean and user-friendly interface for posting and viewing messages.

5. **User Profile:** Users may have the option to customize their profile, including adding a profile picture and other optional details.

6. **Basic Moderation:** The POC may include basic moderation features to handle inappropriate content, such as reporting and flagging messages.

**Benefits:**
- Enhanced Security: Eliminates the need for remembering passwords, reducing the risk of password-related security issues.
- User-Friendly: Simplifies the account creation and login process, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
- Efficient Communication: Facilitates message posting and communication without the need for complex authentication.
- Low Entry Barrier: Encourages user participation by streamlining the onboarding process.

**Implementation Stack:**
- Node.js or Python for server-side development
- Email service integration for sending magic links
- Database for user accounts and message storage
- Web frontend for message board interface

The Email Magic Link Account Creation and Login POC for the message board showcases a password-free and user-centric approach to user registration and login, emphasizing security and ease of use for message board participants.
