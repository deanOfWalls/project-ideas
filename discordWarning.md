**App Name:** Discord Context Alert

**Project Description:**
Discord Context Alert is a practical tool designed to enhance privacy and reduce the risk of sending messages to the wrong chat context within Discord. It operates by detecting the active input field, distinguishing between direct messages (DMs) and server channels. Upon identifying that the user is typing in a server channel, the app displays a clear, unobtrusive warning symbol or text. This feature is particularly useful for preventing the accidental sharing of sensitive or personal information in public or less secure spaces.

**Key Features:**
1. **Context Detection:** Automatically identifies whether the active text input is directed towards a server channel or a direct message, ensuring that users are aware of their messaging context.
2. **Visual Warning System:** Introduces a subtle yet noticeable warning symbol or text when typing in a server channel, serving as a reminder to review the message content before sending.
3. **Customizable Alerts:** Users can customize the appearance and text of the warning to fit their preferences, making the alert as noticeable or discreet as they wish.
4. **Easy Toggle:** The feature can be easily toggled on or off, providing flexibility for users to choose when they need these reminders.
5. **Privacy Protection:** By alerting users before they send messages, the app acts as a safeguard against potential privacy breaches or unintended information disclosure.

**Benefits:**
- Enhances messaging privacy and security within Discord.
- Reduces the likelihood of sending messages to unintended recipients.
- Offers peace of mind for users frequently switching between DMs and server channels.
- Simple, non-intrusive interface that does not disrupt the user experience.

**Implementation Stack:**
- Discord API for detecting active input fields and context.
- Custom GUI for displaying warnings, developed with a lightweight framework compatible with Discord's interface.

Discord Context Alert is a straightforward solution aimed at enhancing user privacy and reducing common messaging errors. It's a personal project, crafted to address the specific need for better context awareness within Discord's messaging platform.
