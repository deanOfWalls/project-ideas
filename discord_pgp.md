**Project Name:** Discord PGP Message Decryption

**Project Description:**
The Discord PGP Message Decryption project aims to enhance security and privacy within Discord chats by implementing a PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) message decryption feature. This project will involve scraping text messages containing PGP message tags from Discord chat channels and, if the user possesses the corresponding public key that was used for encryption and it matches their private key, decrypt the message and replace the PGP encoded block with the decrypted message.

**Key Features:**
1. **Message Scanning:** The project will scan Discord chat messages for text containing PGP message tags or markers, identifying messages that require decryption.

2. **Public Key Management:** Users will have the option to upload and manage their PGP public keys within the application, ensuring secure communication.

3. **Decryption Process:** When a message with a PGP tag is detected, the system will check if the user possesses the appropriate public key and private key pair. If a match is found, it will decrypt the message.

4. **Message Replacement:** Once decrypted, the PGP encoded block will be replaced with the decrypted message, ensuring a seamless and secure chat experience.

5. **User Authentication:** Users will be required to authenticate themselves using their private key passphrase to access their private key for decryption, adding an extra layer of security.

6. **Notification:** Users will receive notifications of decrypted messages to inform them of successful decryption.

7. **Logging and Audit:** The system will maintain logs of decryption activities for auditing purposes, ensuring transparency and accountability.

**Benefits:**
- Enhanced Privacy: Users can securely communicate sensitive information through Discord.
- Preventing Eavesdropping: Protects messages from unauthorized access by third parties.
- User-Friendly: Integration into Discord's chat interface for a seamless experience.
- Transparency: Detailed logs and notifications for user awareness and security.

**Implementation Stack:**
-TBD

**Target Audience:**
- Privacy-conscious Discord users
- Communities or groups sharing sensitive information on Discord

The Discord PGP Message Decryption project aims to provide a valuable solution for secure communication within Discord, ensuring that only authorized users can access and read sensitive messages while maintaining a user-friendly experience.
