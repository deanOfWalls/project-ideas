**Project Name:** Image Steganography Tool with RAR Integration

**Project Description:**
The Image Steganography Tool with RAR Integration is a project designed to offer users a secure and discreet way to hide files within images. Developed using Java and Spring Boot, this tool enables users to upload files they want to hide, which are then added to a password-protected RAR archive using Bash commands. The resulting RAR archive is then seamlessly embedded into a chosen decoy image, creating a stego image that appears normal to the average user.

**Key Features:**
1. **File Upload:** Users can upload files they wish to hide within an image. These files are prepared for steganography.

2. **RAR Integration:** The tool utilizes the ProcessBuilder to execute Bash commands for adding the uploaded files into a password-protected RAR archive.

3. **Decoy Image Selection:** Users can choose a local image to serve as the decoy. This image will conceal the RAR archive containing the hidden files.

4. **Concatenation:** The selected decoy image is concatenated with the password-protected RAR archive, creating a stego image that appears normal to unsuspecting users.

5. **Discreet Operation:** The stego image operates just like a regular image, and to the average user, it does not raise suspicion about the presence of hidden files.

6. **Extraction:** The concealed files can be extracted using the unrar command, with the option to provide the password for added security.

7. **Password Protection:** Users have the option to create the RAR archive with a password, ensuring that the hidden files remain secure.

**Benefits:**
- Secure File Hiding: Provides a secure method for concealing files within images.
- Inconspicuous: The stego image appears ordinary, making it ideal for discreet file storage.
- User-Friendly: Offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for file upload and steganography.
- Password Protection: Enhances security by allowing the RAR archive to be password-protected.

**Implementation Stack:**
- Java for backend development
- Spring Boot for building the web application
- Bash commands for RAR integration and steganography
- Web-based user interface (UI)

**Target Audience:**
- Users looking for a secure and discreet method to hide files within images.
- Professionals and individuals concerned with confidential data storage.

The Image Steganography Tool with RAR Integration is a practical solution for secure file hiding within images, offering users the ability to store sensitive data inconspicuously while maintaining the option for password protection.
