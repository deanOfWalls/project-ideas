**Project Name:** SQL Database Work Log Calendar Viewer POC

**Project Description:**
The SQL Database Work Log Calendar Viewer POC is a web application designed to provide a user-friendly interface for viewing work log history and making entries. This Proof of Concept (POC) leverages SQL database integration to display work logs as a GUI calendar in a web browser, allowing users to easily access their work history and add new log entries during their shifts.

**Key Features:**
1. **Calendar Interface:** The application will present work log entries in a calendar format, making it visually intuitive for users to navigate and view their work history.

2. **SQL Database Integration:** Work log data will be stored in an SQL database, ensuring data reliability and scalability.

3. **Log Entry Form:** Users can input log entries directly through the application. The form will include fields for date, time, task description, and any relevant details.

4. **Date Navigation:** Users can easily switch between dates or navigate through months and years to access their work log history for specific periods.

5. **Search and Filter:** The application may include search and filter options to help users quickly locate specific work log entries based on various criteria.

6. **User Authentication:** To ensure data security, user accounts and authentication may be implemented to restrict access to authorized users.

7. **Export and Reports:** Users may have the option to export work log data or generate reports for their records.

**Benefits:**
- Easy Access: Provides a user-friendly calendar view of work log history, simplifying data access and review.
- Streamlined Data Entry: Allows users to make log entries directly through the application, eliminating manual record-keeping.
- Data Security: Offers user authentication to protect sensitive work log information.
- Organization: Helps users stay organized by visualizing work log data in a calendar format.

**Implementation Stack:**
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Backend: Java, Spring Boot
- Database: SQL (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Web server for hosting

**Target Audience:**
- Professionals and workers who need to maintain a work log for their tasks and activities.
- Managers and supervisors looking for an organized way to track employee work history.

The SQL Database Work Log Calendar Viewer POC demonstrates the feasibility of creating a user-friendly and efficient solution for tracking work log history and making log entries through a web-based calendar interface, enhancing productivity and data management for users.
